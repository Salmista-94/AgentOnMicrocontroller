libmc_sync

This is a sub-library of MobileC. 

This library is meant to manipulate a linked list of mutexes and condition 
variables that any process may create and use. Specifically, it enables a way
for agents in Mobile C to create and share mutexes and condition variables
with each other, thereby providing a level of syncronization among seperate
agents. 

The linked list is a standard singly linked list. The library comes with some
simple routines used for adding new nodes, finding nodes, deleting nodes, etc.

Each node contains a mutex variable, a condition variable, and an integer
variable used as an identifying number. Each node in the list must have a 
unique identifying number. 

The condition and mutex variables within the nodes may be used as the user sees
fit. The user may only use the mutex, or use the mutex in conjunction with 
the condition variable.
