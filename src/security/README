Mobile-C Security Module

The Mobile-C Security Module uses the XySSL-0.7 Library which may be obtained
from http://xyssl.org . The security module currently uses the Diffie-Hellman
protocol for secure message passing. 

The Mobile-C Security Module was designed and prototyped by Cristian Bertocco
<cbertocco@dei.unipd.it>. 

The actual implementation within Mobile-C was done by David Ko 
<dko@ucdavis.edu> and is based on Cristian Bertocco's prototype code.

As per request, the security module may or may not be compiled into the final 
library using a configure option. A runtime option also exists to enable/disable
the security module. Run the configure script with the '--help' argument and see
the MCAgencyOptions_t documentation in the User's guide for more details.
