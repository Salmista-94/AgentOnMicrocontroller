This directory contains some example server and client code utilizing the
MobileC library.

*** Quickstart ***
Inspect and run './configure.guess.sh', and then 'make'.

 **************************************
 *** Full Installation Instructions ***
 **************************************

To build these example programs, you must have:
1: The embedded Ch libraries: Please see http://www.softintegration.com
2: The Mini-XML library: http://www.easysw.com/~mike/mxml/
3: A compiled and working MobileC library

After the libraries are correctly installed, run the configure script

    ./configure

and compile the binaries

    make

To run the test, simply execute the host, and then execute the client. Please
see the README file in the upper directory for more details.

 ***********************************
 *** Compilation troubleshooting ***
 ***********************************

If the configure script gives you an error stating that in cannot find any 
libraries or header files, you may need to manually specify the location
of your libraries and header files. For instance, if my embedded Ch libraries
and header files are in the 

    /usr/local/ch/extern/lib

and
   
    /usr/local/ch/extern/include

directories, respectively, and my MobileC library resided in a nonstandard 
directory like

    /home/david/libmc/

I would configure with the following options:

    ./configure CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/ch/extern/include" \
         LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/ch/extern/lib -L/home/david/libmc"

Run 

    ./configure --help

for more details.
