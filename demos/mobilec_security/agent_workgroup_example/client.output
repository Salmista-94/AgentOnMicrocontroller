Welcome to the Mobile-C agent workgroup demonstration example.
To begin, the demonstration, we will send a worker agent named 
"agent1" to the server agency. "agent1" is not protected by a workgroup
code. Press the return key to send agent1.
agent1 has been sent. You should be able to see agent1's arrival
message on the server agency, and it should begin printing periodic
messages to show that it is working. 

Next, we will send another worker agent, except this second agent,
"agent2", will be protected by a secret workgroup code. This workgroup
code is kept secret and only shared among agents that trust each other.
In our example, the workgroup code we have assigned to "agent2" is
"12345abCD". Press the return key to send agent2.
You should now notice two agents performing work at the server
agency. Next, we will send a malicious agent to the server who's goal is to
terminate other agents. This malicous agent does not belong to any workgroups.
Press the return key to send agent3, the malicious agent.
You should notice now that agent1 has been terminated, but agent2
is still performing its task. This is due to the fact that since agent1 did 
not belong to any workgroups, any agent is able to modify it or terminate
it. However, since agent2 belongs to a different workgroup than agent3,
agent3 is unable to terminate agent2.

Next, we will send an agent in the same workgroup as agent2 to try to
terminate agent2. Press the return key to send agent4, who is also in
the "12345abCD" workgroup who will try to terminate agent2.
You should notice now that all activity has ceased on the server
agency. agent4 was successfully able to terminate agent2 because they belong
to the same workgroup.

Press the return key to end this demo.
