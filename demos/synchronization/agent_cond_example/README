See 'INSTALL' for compilation instructions.

This is a sample test program that demonstrates the usage of MobileC
condition variables. 

*** Test Execution
To run the test, one should:

execute 'mc_server', and
execute 'mc_client'. i.e. in a Unix Bash shell, one may type

    ./mc_server &
    ./mc_client

The test program does the following things.

1. An agent is sent to the test agency. This first agent, called Agent 1,
    initializes a new MobileC synchronization variable uses it as a 
    condition variable. The agent sleeps on the variable, waiting for 
    another thread/agent to signal it.
2. After a five second delay, a second agent is sent to the agency. The
    second agent finds the synchronization variable that the
    first agent had initialized and signals it.
3. At this point, the first agent should wake up and both agents should
    exit gracefully.
