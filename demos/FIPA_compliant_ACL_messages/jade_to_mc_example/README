Jade communication to Mobile-C example

This example is meant to illustrate Mobile-C's ability to parse and interpret
FIPA ACL messages delivered from a JADE agent. To run this demo, perform the
following steps:
  1. Start the 'server' executable. This will start a Mobile-C agency listening
     on port 5050 and automatically load an agent named 'mobagent1'. The agent
     'mobagent' will proceed to wait until a new FIPA ACL message is detected
     in its mailbox.
  2. Start a JADE container. The command
        java jade.Boot -gui
     is usually sufficient. Please consult the JADE website at jade.tilab.com
     for information regarding obtaining, installing, and running JADE.
  3. Start a 'dummy' agent within jade. This may be done by clicking on the
     'dummy' icon located on the toolbox on the top of the JADE gui window.
  4. Use the 'dummy' agent to compose a new ACL message. Set the following 
     fields:
        - Under 'Receivers', add a new receiver with the name 'mobagent1'
          and with an address of 'http://localhost:5050/acc' . 
        - Set the performative to any desired performative.
        - Type a message into the 'content' area
  5. Click on the 'Send' icon to send the newly composed message to the 
     Mobile-C agent. 
  6. Inspect the Mobile-C agency. The 'mobagent1' agent should have received
     the message and printed the performative and content.
