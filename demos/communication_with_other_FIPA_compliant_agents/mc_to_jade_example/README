Mobile-C to Jade FIPA communication Example

This example is intended to test a Mobile-C agent's ability to send a FIPA 
compliant message to a JADE agent. In order to run this example, a JADE agency
must be started. For default operation, the following steps must be performed.

1.  Jade must be started with an agent of type "PingAgent", found in the JADE
    path jade/src/examples/PingAgent/PingAgent.java. From the jade/src directory,
    run the command 
        java jade.Boot pingme:examples.PingAgent.PingAgent
    This will start a Jade container with a Receiver of the name 'pingme'. 
    Please consult the Jade documentation for instructions on how to run and
    troubleshoot Jade.

2. Run the 'client' application from this directory. This program automatically
    starts a Mobile-C agency and loads a Mobile-C agent into it. This agent
    composes and sends a FIPA-ACL message to an agent of the name 'pingme'
    at the Jade agency. The agent code is contained in the file "agent.xml".
