This example directory is used to quickly generate teams of agents, each of which have multiple tasks. The main setup script is called
"template_generator.sh". These agents are used in a relay-race example.
A sample execution of the script would be

    sh ./template_generator.sh 4 10

where the first argument, '4', is the number of agents per team you wish
to generate, and the second argument, '10', is the number of total teams. 
With the above commands, a total of 40 agents will be generated in 10
separate teams.

The shell script reads and uses data from the following files:
  host_list.txt : The script reads this list of hosts for each task. Each host
    should be separated by a newline.
  template_* : These are templates for racers and triggers. Triggers are 
    special racers that start the relay race.
