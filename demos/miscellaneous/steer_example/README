steer_example


This demo is meant to demonstrate a simple steerable algorithm implemented
using the MobileC library. 

- Program Execution Synopsis

The goal of the program is to continuosly run an algorithm. The user should
be able to suspend, stop, resume, or restart the algorithm at will.

- Execution Instructions

Upon starting the 'server' executable, an agency is executed and the algorithm
begins. A trivial algorithm (A counter counting up from 0) is used in this 
example. 

The commands are issued to the algorithm through MobileC agents that may be 
sent from any host, including the local host. A copy of 'mc_sample_app' is
included in this directory which may be used to send agents to the 
algorithm agency. To start the command agency, you must bind it to a 
non-default port since the algorithm agency uses the default port. Execute
  ./mc_sample_app 5051
to start the command agency on port 5051, a non-default port.

To send command agents to the algorithm agency, use the MobileC 'send' command.
From within the mc_sample_app prompt, type
  send restart.xml localhost 5050
to send the restart command agent to the algorithm agent. Type
  help send
from within the MobileC prompt for details about the send command. Sending
'restart.xml' will restart the algorithm. The command agents that are included are:
  restart.xml
  resume.xml
  stop.xml
  suspend.xml
