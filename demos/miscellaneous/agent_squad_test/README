 *** Quickstart ***
Run
    ./configure.guess.sh
If there are errors, edit configure.guess.sh. The format is self explanatory.
Next, run
    make

********************************
*** Compilation Instructions ***
********************************

To build these example programs, you must have:
1: The embedded Ch libraries: Please see http://www.softintegration.com
2: The Mini-XML library: http://www.easysw.com/~mike/mxml/
3: A compiled and working MobileC library

After the libraries are correctly installed, run the configure script

    ./configure

and compile the binaries

    make

To run the test, simply execute the host, and then execute the client. Please
see the README file in the upper directory for more details.

 ***********************************
 *** Compilation troubleshooting ***
 ***********************************

The configure script will attempt to obtain the directory locations for
Ch and Embedded Ch automatically. If this should fail, they may have to
be specified manually. For instance, if my embedded Ch libraries
and header files are in the 

    /usr/local/ch/extern/lib

and
   
    /usr/local/ch/extern/include

directories, respectively, and my MobileC library resided in a nonstandard 
directory like

    /home/david/libmc/

I would configure with the following options:

    ./configure CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/ch/extern/include" \
         LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/ch/extern/lib -L/home/david/libmc"

Run 

    ./configure --help

for more details.
