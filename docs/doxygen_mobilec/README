Doxygen guide


Important parts of the Mobile-C source code are doxygen enabled for quick and
easy reference. In order to generate the doxygen reference, simply run
  doxygen Doxyfile
from this directory. This should generate a directory named 'html' and another 
named 'latex'. To use the html documentation, simply open the file 
'html/index.html' with your favorite web browser. To view the latex 
documentation, build the documentation by these commands:
  cd latex
  make
The file 'refman.pdf' will be produced.

Note that the file 'refman.pdf' in the same directory as this README file is
an up-to-date copy of the file that is produced by typing 'make' within the
'latex' directory.

If you do not have the 'doxygen' program, it may be obtained at
http://www.doxygen.org
