Doxygen guide

The LibMC.NET source code and demo programs are doxygen enabled for quick and easy reference. 
In order to generate the doxygen reference, simply run

doxygen Doxyfile

from this directory. This should generate a directory named 'html' and another named 'latex'.
To use the html documentation, simply open the file 'html/index.html' with your favorite web browser.
To view the latex documentation, build the documentation by these commands:

cd latex
make

The file 'refman.pdf' will be produced.

To build the demo program documentation, run the same commands from the directory ../../../demos/win32/LibMC.Net.
The two documents can be linked together by running the following commands from the directory this file is located in:

cd html
perl installdox -l demos.tag@file:///path/to/mobilec/demos/win32/LibMC.Net/html

where "/path/to/mobilec/" is the directory mobilec was checked out into on your system.
As an example, this command may look like this:

perl installdox -l demos.tag@file:///C:/mobilec/demos/win32/LibMC.Net/html

on a Windows system or:

perl installdox -l demos.tag@/home/dpstark/mobilec/demos/win32/LibMC.Net/html

on a Linux system. The path may need to be adjusted to work properly in your web browser.
