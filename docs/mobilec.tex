Mobile-C is an IEEE FIPA (Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents) standard 
compliant multi-agent platform for supporting C/C++ mobile agents in networked 
intelligent mechatronic and embedded systems. Although it is a general-purpose 
multi-agent platform, Mobile-C is specifically designed for real-time and 
resource constrained applications with interface to hardware. Mobile agents 
are software components that are able to move between different execution 
environments. Mobile agents in a multi-agent system communicate and work 
collaboratively with other agents to achieve a global goal. It allows a 
mechatronic or embedded system to adapt to a dynamically changing environment.

\chapter{Introduction}
Parallel and distributed computing~\cite{Kumar}~\cite{Manber} are widely used 
in scientific and engineering fields, especially for time-critical or 
time-consuming tasks.
Parallel computing is typically carried out in dedicated multiprocessors with
a central clock and shared memory.
On the other hand, distributed computing is decentralized parallel
computing, using two or more computers communicating over a network to
accomplish a common objective or task.
It is similar to computer clustering with the main difference being a wide
geographic dispersion of the resources.
In addition to the main difference, the types of hardware, programming 
languages, operating systems and other resources may vary drastically as well 
in distributed computing.

Although the processing speed of networked computers is typically not as fast 
as that of a dedicated parallel computer, networked computers are less
expensive and more broadly available.
Due to the rapid improvement in network hardware and software that makes
distributed computing faster, more broadly available, and easier-to-implement
than before, there are more and more research investigations nowadays 
targeting or exploiting this low-end, decentralized parallel computing.
Meanwhile, as the scale of distributed applications rapidly expands, 
there is an increasing demand for the code mobility.

Agent technology can significantly enhance the design and analysis of 
problem domains under the following three conditions~\cite{Adler}: 
(1) the problem domain is geographically distributed; 
(2) the subsystems exist in a dynamic environment; 
(3) the subsystems need to interact with each other more flexibly. 
Mobile agents are software components that can travel between 
different execution environments~\cite{Fuggetta}. 
Mobile agents can be created dynamically during runtime and dispatched to 
source systems to perform tasks with the most updated code. 
Therefore, the mobility of mobile agents provides distributed 
applications with significant flexibility and adaptability which are both 
essential to satisfy the dynamically changing requirements and conditions in 
a distributed environment.

Most of the mobile agent systems were developed to support only Java mobile 
agents.
Furthermore, many of them are standalone platforms. 
In other words, they were not designed to be embedded in a user application 
to support code mobility.  
Mobile-C~\cite{Chenthesis}~\cite{Chen3}~\cite{Mobile-C}~\cite{mobilec_webpage} 
was originally developed as a standalone, IEEE Foundation for Intelligent 
Physical Agents (FIPA) compliant mobile agent platform with a primary 
intention to fit applications where low-level hardware gets involved, such as 
networked mechatronic and embedded systems. 
Since most of these systems are written in C/C++, Mobile-C uses C/C++ as 
the mobile agent language for easy interfacing with control programs and 
underlying hardware. 
In addition, Mobile-C uses an embeddable C/C++ interpreter -- Ch, originally 
developed by Cheng~\cite{SP1}~\cite{CUJ1}~\cite{Ch}, to support the execution 
of C/C++ mobile agent code. 

In order to provide distributed applications with code mobility, this 
user's guide presents a mobile agent library, the Mobile-C library. 
The Mobile-C library is supported in various operating systems including 
Windows, Unix, and real-time OS.
It has a small footprint to satisfy the small memory requirement for a 
variety of mechatronic and embedded systems. 
This mobile agent library allows Mobile-C to be embedded in a program to 
support C/C++ mobile agents.
The API functions in this library facilitate the development of a multi-agent
system that can easily interface with a variety of hardware devices.

This chapter describes the prerequisites to install the Mobile-C library and 
the installation steps for both Unix and Windows operating systems.

% SUB: Requirements {{{
\section{Requirements}
This user's guide assumes all necessary software packages are installed
correctly and function. 
The software packages required to successfully install the Mobile-C library 
include:

\noindent
(1) Ch version 6.3.0 or greater: It can be obtained from http://www.softintegration.com

\noindent
(2) Embedded Ch version 6.3.0 or greater: It can be obtained from http://www.softintegration.com

% SUB: Installation on Unix {{{
\section{Installation on Unix}

\subsection{Install the Mobile-C library}
The following commands will install the Mobile-C library in the system 
directory for {\bf 32-bit} Unix systems. 
The system directory for Unix systems is usually `/usr/local/lib' or 
  `/usr/lib' depending on your system.

\begin{verbatim}
    cd <MCPACKAGE>/src
    ./configure
    make
    make install
\end{verbatim}

The following commands will install the Mobile-C library in the system 
  directory for {\bf 64-bit} Unix systems. 
The only difference between the above and below commands is that `fPIC' is 
  added into CFLAGS for compilation.

\begin{verbatim}
    cd <MCPACKAGE>/src
    ./configure CFLAGS=-fPIC
    make
    make install
\end{verbatim}

By default, the Mobile-C library created contains both shared and static 
versions, which are `libmc.so.0.0.0' and `libmc.a', respectively.
The header file, libmc.h, used in the C/C++ binary 
space will be placed in the system directory, which is usually 
`usr/local/include' or `/usr/include' depending on your system.
 
Note that these commands will automatically build mxml-2.2.2 and
xyssl-0.7, both of which are packaged with Mobile-C, but will
not install these libraries. The Mobile-C libraries only need
these libraries to compile, but does not need them installed in
order to run.

Also note that the above commands will automatically compile all the included
demos automatically after compiling the Mobile-C library. The demos will
run even if the 'make install' step is omitted.

The `--prefix' option can be used to specify the home directory to 
install the Mobile-C files, as shown in the following commands.

\begin{verbatim}
    cd <MCPACKAGE>/src
    ./configure --prefix=<MCHOME>
    make
    make install
\end{verbatim}

\noindent
\texttt{<MCPACKAGE>} is the directory created by unpacking the Mobile-C compressed 
tar file.
\texttt{<MCHOME>} is the installation directory for the Mobile-C library and 
header file.\\
\noindent
The library files `libmc.so.0.0.0' and `libmc.a' will be installed in 
\texttt{<MCHOME>/lib}, and the header file `libmc.h' will be placed in 
\texttt{<MCHOME>/include}.

\subsection{Building the Mobile-C Library}
The following steps are suggested to build the Mobile-C library.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Ensure that your \texttt{\_chrc} file in your home directory is up to
  date. The \texttt{\_chrc} file may be opened from the ChIDE text editor by
  opening ChIDE, selecting "Options" from the menu, and selecting the "Open
  Local Ch Startup File" menu item. The section in your \texttt{\_chrc} file
  which contains settings about
  your Visual C++ installation must be correct. 
\item Unpack the Mobile-C source code. Ensure that you have write permissions
  for the directory you are unpacking Mobile-C into, or you may encounter 
  compile-time errors. As mentioned in the previous section, we will refer
  to the unpacked directory as \texttt{<MCPACKAGE>}.
\item Open a Ch terminal.
\item Navigate to the \texttt{<MCPACKAGE>} directory in your Ch terminal. For
  example, if you unpacked Mobile-C to the \texttt{C:$\backslash$Mobile-C} directory, type
  \texttt{cd C:$\backslash$Mobile-C} in your Ch terminal.
\item Type the command \texttt{nmake -f makefile.win32} to build the Mobile-C
  library, as well as all of the demos in the \texttt{<MCPACKAGE>/demos/}
  directory.

\section{Installation on KoreBot}

\subsection{Build the Mobile-C library}
A bash script, \textit{build\_korebot}, is used to build the Mobile-C library 
and an executable sample program, \textit{mc\_sample\_app}, for KoreBot board.

Running the script will create a directory called \textit{korebot\_mc} that 
contains \textit{bin}, \textit{include} and \textit{lib} directories.
\textit{bin} directory contains the executable sample program.    
\textit{include} directory contains the header file \textit{libmc.h}.
\textit{lib} directory contains the Mobile-C related static and shared 
libraries.

Two paths, \textit{KOREBOT\_CHHOME} and \textit{KOREBOT\_TOOLCHAINHOME}, 
in the bash script might need to be changed to match the correct 
paths set up in a user's system.
\textit{KOREBOT\_CHHOME} is the directory containing Ch files built for 
KoreBot board.
\textit{KOREBOT\_TOOLCHAINHOME} is the directory containing cross compiler 
related files for KoreBot board.

% Installing the Mobile-C Ch Package{{{
\section{Installing the Mobile-C Ch Package}
The Mobile-C Ch Package will be required if agents need to use any of the
Mobile-C FIPA ACL message functions, such as \texttt{mc\_AclSend()} or
\texttt{mc\_AclRetrieve()}. To install the Mobile-C Ch package, please follow
these steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item From the Mobile-C root directory, run the command: \\
\texttt{ch ./pkgcreate.ch} \\
This will create a directory called ``\texttt{chmobilec}''.
\item From within a Ch shell, run the command: \\
\texttt{sudo pkginstall.ch chmobilec} \\
If you are using Microsoft Windows, you may omit the "\texttt{sudo}" part of the
command which is required on unix-like systems to ensure proper installation
permassions.

\section{Creating your own compilation environment}
If a custom build environment is required, there are several directories which
must be added to the search paths for header files and libraries. There are 
also a variety of system libraries which Mobile-C must be linked with in order
to compile properly.

\subsection{UNIX and Mac systems}
In order to compile properly, the extra include directory
\texttt{<CHHOME>/extern/include} must be added to the default include search
directories. The directory \texttt{<CHHOME>/extern/lib} must also be added to
the list of searched library directories. Furthermore, the following libraries
must be linked with Mobile-C during the link step:
\begin{itemize}
\item libmxml (Provided with Mobile-C in the directory \texttt{<MCHOME>/src/mxml/})
\item libmc\_list (Provided with Mobile-C in the directory \texttt{<MCCHOME>/src/mc\_list})
\item libmc\_sync (Provided with Mobile-C in the directory \texttt{<MCCHOME>/src/mc\_sync})
\item libdl
\item libpthread
\item libm
\item libcrypt
\item libembedch (Provided with Embedded-Ch)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Windows}
For windows, the include directory \texttt{<CHHOME>/extern/include} must be added
to the include paths and the directory \texttt{<CHHOME>/extern/lib} must be added
to the library search paths. Furthermore, the library \texttt{wsock32.lib} must
be linked with Mobile-C in order to compile properly.

Program \vref{prog:server.c} starts an agency that is capable of 
receiving mobile agents and executing mobile agent code. 

{\footnotesize \linespread{1.0} \verbatiminput{../demos/getting_started/hello_world/server.c.1}}
\noindent
The header file {\bf libmc.h} is included at the beginning of the program. 
It defines all the data types, macros and function prototypes for the 
Mobile-C library.

{\footnotesize \linespread{1.0} \verbatiminput{../demos/getting_started/hello_world/server.c.2}}
\noindent
The variable $agency$, of type {\bf MCAgency\_t}, is a handle that contains 
information of an agency. The second line initializes a local variable that will
hold the port number we wish the agency to bind to.

{\footnotesize \linespread{1.0} \verbatiminput{../demos/getting_started/hello_world/server.c.3}}
\noindent
{\bf MC\_Initialize()} \index{MC\_Initialize()} takes an integer and the address of an 
{\bf MCAgencyOptions\_t} \index{MCAgencyOptions\_t} variable as its two parameters. 
An {\bf MCAgencyOptions\_t} variable is a structure that contains 
information about which threads to be activated and the default agent 
status specified by a user.
Here, a {\bf NULL} pointer is passed to {\bf MC\_Initialize()} as the second 
parameter instead of an MCAgencyOptions\_t variable to start an agency with 
default settings. 
A local agency will be initialized to listen on port {\bf 5051} specified by 
the variable $local\_port$.

{\footnotesize \linespread{1.0} \verbatiminput{../demos/getting_started/hello_world/server.c.4}}
\noindent
The agency waits indefinitely for a mobile agent by the function 
{\bf MC\_MainLoop()} \index{MC\_MainLoop()}. 

Program \ref{prog:client.c} starts an agency that sends a mobile agent to 
a remote agency.
Examining Programs \ref{prog:server.c} and \ref{prog:client.c}, we see
that there are only two new API function calls:
\begin{verbatim}
  agent = MC_ComposeAgentFromFile(
      "mobagent1",      /* Name */
      "localhost:5050", /* Home */
      "IEL",            /* Owner */
      "hello_world.c",  /* Filename */
      NULL,             /* Return var name. NULL for no return */
      "localhost:5051", /* Server to execute task on */
      0 );              /* Persistent. 0 for no persistence. */
\end{verbatim}
and
\begin{verbatim}
  MC_AddAgent(agency, agent);
\end{verbatim}

Mobile-C agents may be created from existing source code files. The example
above takes a source code file called \texttt{hello\_world.c} and constructs
an agent around it. The agent's name, home, owner, return variable name,
and the host on which to execute the agent are all provided as arguments
to the \texttt{MC\_ComposeAgentFromFile()} function. 

Then, the newly created agent is added to the local agency so that it may
perform its local and/or remote tasks. In our example, the agent has
one remote task, so the agent will migrate to the remote host and perform
its task there. 

Also note that any valid hostname may be used in place of ``localhost''. The
communicating agencies need not be on the same physical machine; in fact, in most
cases they will be on seperate machines. Any IPv4 string, i.e. ``169.237.104.199'', or
qualified hostname, i.e. ``machine.ucdavis.edu'', may be used. For instance, the
code
\begin{verbatim}
    MC_ComposeAgentFromFile(
                "Bob",
                "iel.ucdavis.edu:5050",
                "IEL",
                "source_code.c",
                "169.237.104.199:5055",
                NULL,
                0);
\end{verbatim}
will send an agent to the server at address ``169.237.104.199'' listening on
port 5055. Or,
\begin{verbatim}
    MC_ComposeAgentFromFile(
                "Lou",
                "iel.ucdavis.edu:5055",
                "IEL",
                "agent_source.c",
                "machine.ucdavis.edu:5031",
                NULL,
                0);
\end{verbatim}
will send the agent to an agency at ``machine.ucdavis.edu'' listening on 
port 5031.

% SUB: Mobile-C Bluetooth Agencies {{{
\section{Mobile-C Bluetooth Agencies (Experimental)}
As of Mobile-C version 2.0.2, Mobile-C has support for using Bluetooth
as the agent message transport medium as opposed to the standard TCP/IP.
A new option has been added to the \texttt{MCAgencyOptions\_t} structure
to indicate whether or not Mobile-C should start as a Bluetooth enabled
agency.

Please note that currently, Mobile-C is unable to start as both a Bluetooth
agency and a standard TCP/IP agency. That is, if a Mobile-C agency is
initialized to communicate via Bluetooth, that same agency will not be able to
communicate via TCP/IP, and vise versa. 

When Mobile-C is initialized as a Bluetooth agency, it enables Mobile-C to
send and receive messages to other Mobile-C Bluetooth agencies, via the
short/medium range Bluetooth wireless protocol. A sample Mobile-C 
server program that listens for incoming connections is shown below.

{\footnotesize \linespread{1.0} \verbatiminput{../demos/getting_started/bluetooth/server.c}}

Note that this program is very similar to the previous ``hello world''
server.c, seen at Program \ref{prog:server.c}. One major difference to take
note is the line which reads

\begin{verbatim}
options.bluetooth = 1;
\end{verbatim}

This line sets the option in the Mobile-C options structure to inform Mobile-C
to initialize as a Bluetooth agency.

Also note the initializing port number. Bluetooth RFCOMM port numbers are
limited to values from 0 to 30. The value  ``20'' was chosen arbitrarily, but
it must lie between zero and thirty. 

The client program, which sends an agent to the server agency, is also similar
to the previous client program seen at Program \ref{prog:client.c}.

{\footnotesize \linespread{1.0} \verbatiminput{../demos/getting_started/bluetooth/client.c}}

Note that the hostname supplied to the \texttt{MC\_ComposeAgentFromFile()}
function is composed of the MAC address of the server Bluetooth device,
followed by a space, followed by the port the server agency is listening on.

% SUB: Execution of Sample Applications {{{
\section{Execution of Sample Applications}
In general, each of the demos is designed to have very similar execution
procedures. For each demo, there are one or more ``servers'', which are
simply vanilla Mobile-C agencies. To run the demo, start all of the servers
(there is only one server for most of the demos), and start the ``client''
program. Generally, the client program also starts a Mobile-C agency,
but it typically sends an agent to a destination as part of its startup
process as well.

For example, to run the Mobile-C ``Hello World'' example, 
run the following commands from a text terminal on the server machine
to start an agency listening on port {\bf 5051}.

\begin{verbatim}
    cd <MCPACKAGE>/demos/hello_world
    ./server
\end{verbatim}

\noindent
Next, run the following commands from a text terminal on the client machine
to start an agency listening on 
port {\bf 5050} and send the mobile agent to the remote agency 
listening on port {\bf 5051}.\\

\begin{verbatim}
    cd <MCPACKAGE>/demos/hello_world
    ./client
\end{verbatim}

\noindent
After the mobile agent message is received and the mobile agent code is 
executed, the string {\bf Hello World!} should be printed to the text terminal 
on the server machine. Note that in this example, both the server and client
are running on the same machine, but this is not a requirement. The field
``localhost'' may be replaced with any qualified domain name or IP address.

\section{The Mobile-C Library}
The Mobile-C library allows a Mobile-C agency to be embedded in a program to 
support C/C++ mobile agents.
In addition, the Mobile-C API gives users a full control over a Mobile-C 
agency embedded in a program. 
Therefore, the Mobile-C library not only provides a significant code mobility 
for distributed applications, but also facilitates the development of a 
multi-agent system that can easily interface with various hardware devices.

\subsection{Architecture of the Mobile-C Library \label{mobilec_arch}}
Figure \ref{fig:mobilec_lib_arch} illustrates the architecture of the 
Mobile-C library.
The Mobile-C library allows a Mobile-C agency to be embedded in a program to 
support C/C++ mobile agents.
A Mobile-C agency refers to a mobile agent platform within which mobile agents 
exist and operate.
The Mobile-C API gives users a full control over a Mobile-C agency and its 
different modules.
 
As a IEEE FIPA compliant mobile agent platform, a Mobile-C agency 
comprises three FIPA normative modules, Agent Management System (AMS), 
Agent Communication Channel (ACC) and Directory Facilitator (DF). 
Two additional modules, Agent Execution Engine (AEE) and 
Agent Security Manager (ASM), are included in a Mobile-C agency as well.
These modules provide different functionalities summarized as follows.

\textit{Agent Management System (AMS)}

\noindent
An AMS controls the creation, registration, execution, migration, 
persistence, and termination of a mobile agent. 
It maintains a directory of Agent Identifiers (AIDs) for registered mobile 
agents. 
Each mobile agent must register with an AMS in order to have a valid AID.

\textit{Agent Communication Channel (ACC)}

\noindent
An ACC routes messages between local and remote entities. 
It is responsible for the interactions between distributed components, such 
as inter-agent communication and inter-platform agent transport. 
The interactions can be performed through Agent Communication Language (ACL) 
message exchange.

\textit{Directory Facilitator (DF)}

\noindent
A DF serves yellow page services. 
Mobile agents wishing to advertise their services should register with a DF. 
Visiting mobile agents can search a DF for mobile agents providing the 
services they desire.

\textit{Agent Execution Engine (AEE)}

\noindent
An AEE serves as the execution environment for mobile agent code.
An AEE has to be platform independent in order to support the execution of 
mobile agents in a heterogeneous environment. 

Each AEE contains an Embedded Ch interpreter to interpret the agent C code.
By default, the agency will preload four interpreters upon startup for
interpreting agents. If more than four interpreters are required, the agency
will dynamically allocate extra interpreters as needed. See the reference for
\texttt{MC\_Initialize()} on page \pageref{api:MC_Initialize} for more info.

\textit{Agent Security Manager (ASM)}

\noindent
An ASM is responsible for maintaining securita policies for the host system.
Some sample tasks of an ASM include identifying users, protecting host 
resources, authenticating and authorizing mobile agents, and ensuring the 
security and integrity of mobile agents.

% SUB: Implementation of the Mobile-C Library {{{
\subsection{Implementation of the Mobile-C Library}
Figure \ref{fig:mobilec_lib_imp} shows the implementation overview of the 
Mobile-C library.
The functionalities of each module of an agency are 
implemented as independent threads classified into five categories, that is, 
the AMS functionality threads, the ACC functionality threads, the DF 
functionality threads, the ASM functionality threads and the AEE threads.
Each AEE thread is launched by one of the AMS functionality threads.

The Mobile-C library provides API functions to specify which thread needs to 
be active or inactive when an agency is initialized.
It also provides API functions to access the input and output data structures 
associated with the functionality threads.
A Mobile-C agency maintains a list of synchronization variables that can be 
used with a group of Mobile-C functions to ensure synchronization among 
mobile agents and threads.
The sizes of the Mobile-C static and shared libraries for Linux are about 
500 KB and 390 KB, respectively.

The header file \textit{libmc.h} contains definitions of all the structures and 
functions of the Mobile-C library. 
Table \vref{mobilec_api_cbinary} lists the currently implemented functions 
for the binary space.

% Composing Agents {{{
\chapter{Composing Agents}
Mobile-C agents are represented internally as XML data structures. However,
dealing with XML code requires background knowledge of XML and may be cumbersome.
To enhance the convenience of creating and deploying Mobile-C agents,
several different methods of creating agents from C source code files have
been implemented.

Agents may be composed from plain C source code. There are two main ways to
compose Mobile-C agents. Agents may be composed by using the
\texttt{compose\_send} commmand in the Mobile-C prompt, or by using the
\texttt{MC\_ComposeAgent*} series of API functions.

\section{Mobile-C Command Prompt \texttt{compose\_send} Command}
The \texttt{compose\_agent} takes a C source code file and creates
a fully functioning agent out of it. The \texttt{compose\_send} command
syntax is
\begin{verbatim}
compose_send <filename> <target host> <target port>
\end{verbatim}
Many details about an agent generated in this method, such as the agent's
name and owner, are dynamically generated when creating an agent using 
this method. 
\subsection{Example Execution Using the \texttt{compose\_send} Command}
The demo \texttt{prompt\_example} has been provided with the Mobile-C
package. Note that the source code for both servers is virtually identical to
that in Program \ref{prog:server.c}, except with added execution
instructions.
The demo program is initiated by starting the first agency, named
\texttt{server1}.
\begin{verbatim}
$ ./server1
Agency 1 started. Please start the second agency by running the command
"server2" on another terminal.

MobileC >
\end{verbatim}
Next, the second agency is started on a seperate terminal.
\begin{verbatim}
$ ./server2
Starting Agency...
You may now try the following commands:

  compose_send helloworld.c localhost 5050

The previous command will compose an agent using the source
code in "helloworld.c" and send it to the other agency at
port 5050. Then try this command:

  compose_send helloworld.c localhost 5051

This will send the "hello_world.c" agent to the local agency.
You may also try these commands at the other agency.

MobileC >
\end{verbatim}
Following the instructions on the second agency, we execute the 
suggested \texttt{compose\_send} command. The first agency terminal
now appears as such:
\begin{verbatim}
$ ./server1
Agency 1 started. Please start the second agency by running the command
  "server2" on another terminal.

MobileC > Hello, world!
\end{verbatim}
Note that the source file \texttt{helloworld.c} has been composed into a 
mobile agent, migrated to the \texttt{server1} agency, and executed.

\section{Mobile-C \texttt{MC\_ComposeAgent*} Functions}
There also exist a set of API functions which compose agents from C source
files. These functions are
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{MC\_ComposeAgent()} : Compose an agent from program source code. 
\item \texttt{MC\_ComposeAgentWithWorkgroup()} : Compose an agent from program source code with a workgroup code. 
\item \texttt{MC\_ComposeAgentFromFile()} : Compose an agent from a program source code file. 
\item \texttt{MC\_ComposeAgentFromFileWithWorkgroup()} : Compose an agent from a program source code file with a workgroup code. 
\item \texttt{MC\_AgentAddTask()} : Add an additional task to an already formed agent.
\item \texttt{MC\_AgentAddTaskFromFile()} : Add an additional task to an already formed agent from a C source code file.
\end{itemize}
For an example of the usage of these functions, please refer to program
\ref{prog:compose_multi_task_agent}.

\caption{An agency building an agent with multiple tasks from seperate source code files.}
\label{prog:compose_multi_task_agent}
\end{Program}

\section{Agent Workgroups}
In order to provide an added layer of organization and security, agents
may be created which belong to a workgroup. A workgroup's name may be an
ASCII text string of any length. If an agent belongs in a workgroup,
then certain actions on that agent may only be performed by other agents
in the same workgroup. Thus, if a group of agents keeps their workgroup
name private, no agents outside of that group will be able to terminate,
delete, or otherwise affect the agents within the workgroup. All agents are
still able to interact through FIPA ACL messages.

For an example of agent workgroups in action, please see the demo program
in the\\
 \texttt{demos/agent\_workgroup\_example} directory.

% Agent Data {{{
\chapter{Agent Data}
Agents have the ability to carry pieces of data with them as they migrate from
host to host. The data carried by an agent can be categorized into two broad
types: ``agent return data'' and ``agent saved variables''. 

\section{Agent Return Data}
  ``Agent return data'' is typically used to store a piece of data being
returned to the agent's home agency. For instance, if an agent is given a task
to obtain a single result from a remote host, the agent might store the result
as its agent return data. An agent may hold a single return value for each one
of its tasks. The return value may be of any standard C type, or an array of 
such a type. For instance, the \texttt{double} type, as well as
\texttt{double[5][3]} are both valid types for a piece of agent return data,
since both are examples of a standard C type or an array of a standard type.
User defined structs and unions may not be returned as a piece of return data.
 
In order to return a variable as agent return data, the name of the return variable
simply needs to be specified when composing the agent. No further API calls need to be
executed from within the agent code. Note that the return variable must be declared as
a global variable in the agent code.
For an example of an agent with multiple tasks returning information to its home agency,
please see Program \ref{prog:compose_multi_task_agent} on page
\pageref{prog:compose_multi_task_agent}.

\section{Agent Saved Variables} 
An ``agent saved variable'' is also carried with an agent as it migrates. However,
this type of variable is typically used for data that the agent itself has access
to as it completes its tasks. Furthermore, an agent may save the value of as many
variables as it desires per task. For instance, during an agent's first task, it
may save various values, like the number of other agents on the agency as an
\texttt{int}, and the name of the agency as a \texttt{char[80]}. After it
migrates to it's second task, it may access the variables it saved previously
on the first host. In this way, an agent could calculate the total number of
active agents in an agency network. In summary,

\begin{tabular}{l|cc}
 & Agent Return Data & Agent Saved Variable \\
\hline
May save multiple variables per task & & X \\
\hline
Data easily retrieved by home agency & X & X \\
\hline
Data saved to agent automatically  & & \\
without agent-space API calls & X & \\
\hline
Agent can access its own saved data & & X
\end{tabular}

\vspace{0.18in}
For example, consider an agent with the following tasks. The agent's first task
appears as such:
\verbatiminput{../demos/agent_migration_message_format/agent_saved_variables_example/task1.c}
Note that the variable to be saved must be a global variable. In the agent code, the agent
performs a call to the function \texttt{mc\_AgentVariableSave(mc\_current\_agent, "savevar");}
The first argument in the function is a handle to an agent. The handle \texttt{mc\_current\_agent} is
a special handle an agent has to itself. The second argument is a character string denoting the
name of the variable to save. In effect, this code saves the value of \texttt{savevar} to
itself. As shown in the preceding code, the \texttt{mc\_AgentVariableSave()} function may
be called multiple times on differing variable types and arrays. Each variable will be
saved to the agent prior to migration.

Here is an example of the agent's second task's code:
\verbatiminput{../demos/agent_migration_message_format/agent_saved_variables_example/task2.c}
Note the call to \texttt{mc\_AgentVariableRetrieve(mc\_current\_agent,
"savevar", 0);} in this code example. This function attempts to retrieve a
pointer to the saved variable. The first argument, as seen before, is a handle
to the agent itself. The second variable is the name of the variable to
retrieve. The third argument is the task from which to retrieve the variable,
with the value \texttt{0} being the first task. If the call succeeds, it will
return a valid pointer to the saved variable. If it fails, the function returns
\texttt{NULL}.

% Mobile-C Agent Migration Message Format {{{
\chapter{Mobile-C Agent Migration Message Format}
\section{General Message Format \label{sec:gen_message_format}}
\begin{Program}
\begin{center}
   {\scriptsize \linespread{1.0} \verbatiminput{../demos/getting_started/hello_world/test1.xml}}
\end{center}
\caption{A rudimentary agent. (demos/getting\_started/hello\_world/test1.xml)}
\label{prog:hello_agent}
\end{Program}
The message format for an agent migration message is designed such that
multiple tasks and multiple code blocks can be migrated from agency to
agency. The message is an XML message with encapsulated C code. An example
of a rudimentary agent can be seen in Program \ref{prog:hello_agent} on 
page \pageref{prog:hello_agent}. 
Following is a brief description of each XML tag.
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{MESSAGE}: This tag indicates to Mobile-C that the following data
  is a Mobile-C message. The message type is included in the attribute
  ``message''.
\item \texttt{MOBILE\_AGENT}: This tag indicates that the contained data is a 
  Mobile-C agent.
\item \texttt{AGENT\_DATA}: This tag indicates that the contained data is data pertaining
  to this particular agent.
\item \texttt{NAME}: The name of the agent.
\item \texttt{OWNER}: The owner of the agent. 
\item \texttt{HOME}: The home of the agent. Any agent that has data to ``return'' will
	return it to this address by default.
\item \texttt{WG\_CODE}: The workgroup code of the agent. Workgroup codes are
kept secret by the agent. Only agents with matching workgroup codes are allowed
to perform certain operations on each other, such as agent deletion.
\item \texttt{TASKS}: This indicates that the following information pertains to the
  task or tasks the agent is intended to perform. Attributes found under the
  \texttt{TASKS} tag include:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{task} : The total number of tasks the agent has.
    \item \texttt{num} : The task that the agent is currently on.
  \end{itemize}
\item \texttt{TASK}: Each seperate \texttt{TASK} tag indicates a seperate task for the agent
  to perform. The tasks may be seperate hosts and/or code blocks. In the
  rudimentary example, there is only one task. Listed below are the attributes of 
  \texttt{TASK} tags.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{num}:           The number of the task. The first task is task number zero.
  \item \texttt{complete}:      Completeness of the task
  \item \texttt{server}:        The host to perform the task
  \item \texttt{return}:        Name of the return variable
  \item \texttt{persistent}:    Persistence of the agent
  \item \texttt{return\_value}: Return value, if not an array
  \item \texttt{code\_id}:      ID of the code block to execute
  \end{itemize}
\textit{complete} and \textit{server} are mandatory attributes, and others are 
optional attributes.  
\item AGENT\_CODE: Each AGENT\_CODE block represents a block of code that 
  the agent may execute. Agents with multiple code blocks may decide at run-time
  which block to execute. Valid attributes under the \texttt{AGENT\_CODE} tag
  include
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{id}: The id of the code segment, as referenced by the \texttt{TASK} 
      attribute, \texttt{code\_id}.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Multiple Tasks with a Single Code Block}
An agent may have an indefinite number of tasks. The agent will perform the tasks
in ther order that they are stated in the XML file, completing each one before
continuing to the next host. Following is an example of an agent which has
multiple tasks to perform, executing the same code block at each new host.
See Program \ref{prog:single_code_block} on page \pageref{prog:single_code_block} 
for an example.

\section{Multiple Tasks with Multiple Code Blocks}
See Program \ref{prog:multi_code_block} on page \pageref{prog:multi_code_block}
for a more complicated example of agent code including multiple tasks and
  multiple code blocks. Note that each code block has an associated ID which is 
  refered to in the respective ``DATA'' tags. Also note that more than one ``DATA'' tag
  may refer to the same code block. Thus, an agent may have more ``DATA'' tags than
  code blocks.

\section {Multiple Mobile Agent performs Task on Multiple Hosts}
Program \ref{prog:multi_mobile_agent_client} on page \pageref{prog:multi_mobile_agent_client} is a client that sends two different mobile agents to two different hosts. In for loop, it waits for the arrival signal of mobile agent. When an agent arrives it prints the result and delete that agent. For loop is iterated same as total number of mobile agents send by client. The two mobile agents having different name are shown in Program \ref{prog:mobile_agent_1} and Program \ref{prog:mobile_agent_2}:

\end{Program}

\section{Agent Return Messages}
If the ``\texttt{name}'' attribute in an agent's ``\texttt{DATA}'' tag
is not set to ``\texttt{no-return}'', the agent will generate an
agent-return message upon completion of all of its tasks. The agent will
generate a return message containing the contents of the variable name
specified in the ``\texttt{name}'' attribute. For instance, Program
\vref{prog:agent_with_return_data} shows a simple agent which 
will migrate to another agency, generate a three-dimensional array called
``\texttt{a}'', and return the contents of the array to the ``\texttt{HOME}''
host upon completion. Note that the return variable must be global
so that the contents are not destroyed upon completion of the \texttt{main}
function. 
  
  An example of the return message that is generated by
this agent can be seen in Program \vref{prog:return_agent}. Notice also in
the return message that the variable type has been changed from ``int'' as it
was in the original program to ``short'' and that the ``\texttt{dim}'' attribute
has been changed to $3$. This is because Mobile-C automatically
checks the type and dimension of the variable it is returning and assign
those attributes automatically.

\caption{Agent return data xml format. Note: This XML code has been reformatted
  to a more human-readable format. The actual format generated may differ.}
\label{prog:return_agent}
\end{Program}

\section{Agent Saved Variables}
As of Mobile-C version 1.10.0, Mobile-C agents have the ability to save an 
arbitrary number of variables while migrating from task to task. Agents may
use the agent-space api functions \texttt{mc\_AgentVariableSave()} and
\texttt{mc\_AgentVariableRetrieve} to save and later retrieve variables.
An example agent which does this may be viewed at the documentation for
the \texttt{mc\_AgentVariableSave()} and \linebreak \texttt{mc\_AgentVariableRetrieve()}
functions on pages \pageref{apidoc:mc_AgentVariableSave} and 
\pageref{apidoc:mc_AgentVariableRetrieve}, respectively.

As the agent is migrating from host to host with saved data, the data is 
encapsulated in the agent's XML code. \texttt{<DATA>} tags are created as
children of each \texttt{<TASK>} tag to store data. See Program 
\ref{prog:migrating_agent} for an example of an agent that is migrating
with saved data. The valid attributes within a \texttt{<DATA>} tag are
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{name}: The name of the saved variable.
\item \texttt{dim}: The array dimension of the saved variable. 
\item \texttt{type}: The type of the variable.
\item \texttt{value}: (optional) If the variable has zero dimensions, the
  value is stored in this attribute. Otherwise, children \texttt{<ROW>} 
  tags must be created to store the array.
\end{itemize}

Each \texttt{<DATA>} tag may also have children \texttt{<ROW>} tags, if
the data is an array. The valid attributes of the \texttt{<ROW>} tags are
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{index}: The index of the row.
\end{itemize}
Note also that each \texttt{<ROW>} tag may contain additional \texttt{<ROW>}
children depending on the dimension of the array being stored.

The Mobile-C XML Data Type Definition (DTD), which defines the format of a
well-formed Mobile-C agent migration message, may be seen in Section
\ref{sec:xml_dtd} on page \pageref{sec:xml_dtd}.

\section{Stationary/Persistent Mobile Agents}
A Stationary agent may be achieved in Mobile-C simply by creating an agent which
never migrates. This is commonly achieved using a couple of different
techniques.
\subsection{An Agent with an Infinite Task}
An agent may be considered stationary if it's task never ends. For instance, if
the task of an agent is of the form:
\begin{verbatim}
while(1)
{
    cmd = wait_for_command();
    execute_command(cmd);
}
\end{verbatim}
Since the previous task never ends, the agent will never terminate and the agent
will remain stationary in it's agency. 

\subsection{The ``\texttt{persistent}'' Agent Flag}
The ``\texttt{persistent}'' flag as mentioned in Section
\ref{sec:gen_message_format} may be used to create a persistent agent. The
example described in Chapter \ref{chap:interface_binary_to_agent} uses such a
technique. This technique creates an agent which is not automatically flushed by the agency
after it completes it's task. Thus, the agent remains dormant and stationary in
the agency without external stimulus.

\subsubsection{Terminating Persistent Agents}
Persistent agents should be terminated when they are no longer needed to free
up resources. They may be terminated by using the API functions 
\texttt{MC\_DeleteAgent()} or \texttt{MC\_TerminateAgent()} functions from C-space,
or the functions \texttt{mc\_DeleteAgent()} or \texttt{MC\_TerminateAgent()} functions 
from agent-space. Since a persistent agent cannot terminate itself, it is up to either
the host agency or another agent to terminate the persistent agent.

multi-dimensional arrays.}

\chapter{Mobile-C FIPA Compliant ACL Messages \label{chap:fipa}}
Mobile-C has the ability to send and receive FIPA compliant
agent communication language (ACL) messages. More information
about FIPA, the Foundation for Intellegent Physical Agents, may be
found at \texttt{http://www.fipa.org}. This functionality allows
Mobile-C agent to communicate with each other, as well as with 
agents from other agencies that are also FIPA compliant. Demos
of communication with JADE agents may be found in the directories
\texttt{<MCPACKAGE>/demos/jade\_to\_mc\_example} and \\
\texttt{<MCPACKAGE>/demos/mc\_to\_jade\_example}.

%{{{ Constructing and Sending an ACL Message
\section{Constructing and Sending an ACL Message}
The general process for constructing an ACL message involves
filling out required portions of an ACL message structure of type
\texttt{struct fipa\_acl\_message\_s} and passing the message to the
\texttt{MC\_AclSend()} function. A number of helper functions 
exist in order to simplify the process of allocating memory and setting
certain fields of the acl message. 
Some typical functions used to compose a new ACL message are the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{MC\_AclSetPerformative}: Set the FIPA performative of the message. See Program
  \ref{prog:fipa_enum} for a complete listing of valid FIPA performative enumerations.
\item \texttt{MC\_AclSetSender}: Sets the 'sender' field of the message.
\item \texttt{MC\_AclAddReceiver}: Adds addresses to the 'receiver' field of the message.
\item \texttt{MC\_AclSetContent}: Sets the 'content' field of an ACL message.
\end{itemize}

\section{Receiving an ACL Message}
Every agent residing on a Mobile-C agency has a mailbox allocated to it.
At any time, the agent may check the mailbox for new ACL messages, or an
agent may choose to wait on an empty mailbox until a new message arrives.
These two tasks are done by the functions \texttt{MC\_AclRetreive()} and
\texttt{MC\_AclWaitRetrieve()}, respectively. 
Another useful function which may be used with a received ACL message is the
\texttt{MC\_AclReply()} function. This function takes an ACL message as an
input argument and automatically forms an ACL reply message addressed to the
original sender. Note that the performative and new sender fields in the reply
message are not automatically initialized and will still need to be set by
the agent. A detailed example of an agent receiving and replying to a message
may be found in Chapter \ref{chap:stationary_agent}.

% Mobile-C Binary Stationary Agents {{{
\chapter{Mobile-C Binary Stationary Agents \label{chap:stationary_agent}}
Mobilec has support for hosting binary-space stationary agents. The
agents are implemented as system threads. As such, the only limit 
to the number of stationary agents residing on an agency are the
system resources of the host agency. 

The binary agents are able to call any of the C-space API functions, such as
\texttt{MC\_AclWaitRetrieve()}. This allows stationary agents to communicate
and interact with other mobile and stationary agents using FIPA ACL messages,
as introduced in Chapter \ref{chap:fipa}.

Stationary agents may be used in any application in which agent mobility is
unnecessary. Stationary agents can typically perform any task a mobile agent
can perform, except migration. Furthermore, stationary agents tend to execute
faster and consume less system resources.

Mobile-C stationary agent threads are added using the
\texttt{MC\_AddStationaryAgent()} API function. See Program 
\ref{prog:stationary_agent_server} for an example of a stationary agent. 

\begin{Program}[!t]
\begin{center}
   {\footnotesize \linespread{1.0} \verbatiminput{../demos/binary_stationary_agents/stationary_agent_communication/server.c}}
\end{center}
\caption{A sample program which starts a single stationary agent that responds to FIPA ACL messages.}
\label{prog:stationary_agent_server}
\end{Program}

The \texttt{MC\_AddStationaryAgent()} function takes three arguments:
\begin{enumerate}
\item A handle to the home agency. This is the agency the new agent will reside under.
\item The agent thread. This is a pointer to a function which will execute and act as
the stationary agent. If the function returns, the stationary agent is terminated.
\item An optional argument to pass to the agent. If additional information or data needs
to be passed to the stationary agent thread, a pointer of any type may be supplied as the
third argument to \\
\texttt{MC\_AddStationaryAgent()}. This pointer may later be retrieved
with the \\
\texttt{MC\_AgentInfo\_GetAgentArgs()} function from within the agent.
\end{enumerate}

The stationary agent thread must have a prototype of the form
\begin{verbatim}
void* agent_func_name(stationary_agent_info_t* agent_info);
\end{verbatim}
As seen in the prototype, the agent thread receives an argument of type
\texttt{stationary\_agent\_info\_t}. This special type is a structure 
which contains information about the the agent, such as its name, and the
location of its mailbox. Certain information may be retrieved from the 
function parameter by using the \texttt{MC\_AgentInfo\_*} series of API
functions, which include:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{MC\_AgentInfo\_GetAgency()} : Retrieves a handle to the host agency.
\item \texttt{MC\_AgentInfo\_GetAgent()} : Retrieves a handle to the agent
information structure.
\item \texttt{MC\_AgentInfo\_GetAgentArgs()} : Retrieves the pointer that was
given as an agent argument during the call to \texttt{MC\_AddStationaryAgent}.
\end{itemize}

Example usage of these functions may be seen in Program \ref{prog:stationary_agent_server}.

% Interface between Binary and Mobile Agent Spaces {{{
\chapter{Interface between Binary and Mobile Agent Spaces
\label{chap:interface_binary_to_agent}}
An embeddable C/C++ interpreter Ch was chosen to be the AEE in the Mobile-C 
library to support C/C++ mobile agents. 
Therefore, in order to access the variables, functions, and data sets in 
the mobile agent space from the binary space, Ch must be first embedded in the 
binary space.
The function \textit{MC\_GetAgentExecEngine()} \index{MC\_GetAgentExecEngine()} in 
Table \ref{mobilec_api_cbinary} returns the AEE associated with a mobile agent 
to the binary space.
Using the AEE returned by \textit{MC\_GetAgentExecEngine()}, all of the 
Embedded Ch functions~\cite{EmbeddedCh} can be called in a binary C/C++ 
program to access the variables, functions, and data sets defined in the 
mobile agent space.
The Embedded Ch toolkit also allows mobile agent code to invoke C/C++ 
functions defined in a binary C/C++ program.

The Embedded Ch toolkit reduces the complexity of heterogeneous development 
environment for both embedded scripting and applications. 
With the consistent C/C++ code base, it can significantly reduce the effort 
in the software development and maintenance. 
Moreover, with the Embedded Ch toolkit, C/C++ applications can be extended 
with all the features of Ch including built-in string type for scripting. 
The Embedded Ch toolkit has a small footprint. 
The pointer and time deterministic nature of the C language provide a 
perfect interface with hardware in real-time systems.

\section{Using an Agent Initialization Callback Function to Intergrate Binary
and Script Space Code}
The user may register a callback function to be called during the initialization
of mobile agents inside of an agency. This allows the user to fine-tune 
an agent and the Ch interpreter before an agent is executed. The callback
function is added using the \texttt{MC\_AddAgentInitCallback()} function,
and the callback function is of the form
\begin{verbatim}
int callback(ChInterp_t interp, MCAgent_t agent, void* user_data);
\end{verbatim}
The user may call any applicable Ch API function on the interpreter,
as well as any applicable Mobile-C API function on the supplied agent.
For instance, the user may use the \texttt{Ch\_DeclareVar()} function
to declare extra variables inside of the interpereter which the agent
will be able to access during its execution. 

The demo located at \texttt{demos/cspace-agentspace\_interface/agent\_init\_callback/} 
provides a demonstration of the callback function. This demo uses the callback
function to declare a new function in each of the incoming agent interpreters
called \texttt{mult()}, which simply multiplies two numbers together. This
means that any incoming agent will be able to call the \texttt{mult()} function,
which resides in C-space, from the agent script-space. This demo may also be seen with
the documentation for \texttt{MC\_AddAgentInitCallback()} on page \pageref{api:MC_AddAgentInitCallback()}.

This example illustrates how to call a function defined in mobile agent 
code by using the Mobile-C library and Embedded Ch toolkit. 
The mobile agent in this example is a persistent agent, which is not removed 
upon termination of its execution.

The client program shown in Program \vref{prog:client_ex2.c} starts a Mobile-C 
agency listening on port \textit{5050} by the function 
\textit{MC\_Initialize()}, and sends a mobile agent to the remote agency 
running on host \textit{localhost} at port \textit{5051} through 
the function \textit{MC\_SendAgentMigrationMessageFile()}. 
The filename including the full path of the mobile agent is specified from the 
standard input.

The mobile agent sent to the remote agency is 
shown in Program \vref{prog:mobileagent_ex2.xml}. 
The name, owner, source machine of the mobile agent are 
\textit{mobagent1}, \textit{IEL}, and 
\textit{localhost:5050}, respectively. 
The mobile agent is persistent since the flag \textit{persistent}\index{persistent} 
is set to 1 
in Program \ref{prog:mobileagent_ex2.xml}.
This flag can be set to 0 or removed by a user for a non-persistent mobile 
agent.
The embedded mobile agent code is a simple but complete C program which 
defines the function \textit{hello()} to be called in the server program. 

As shown in Program \vref{prog:server_ex2.c}, the server program starts a 
Mobile-C agency listening on port \textit{5051} by the 
function \textit{MC\_Initialize()}, and waits for a mobile agent.  
The mobile agent named \textit{mobagentl} is found by the function 
\textit{MC\_FindAgentByName()} \index{MC\_FindAgentByName()}, and the AEE 
associated with the mobile 
agent is obtained by the function \textit{MC\_AgentExecEngine()} 
\index{MC\_AgentExecEngine()}.
The variable returned by \textit{MC\_AgentExecEngine()} is a Ch interpreter of 
data type \textit{ChInterp\_t}. 
This variable is the first parameter for all of the Embedded Ch functions. 
The function \textit{hello()} defined in the mobile agent code is invoked 
by the Embedded Ch function \textit{Ch\_CallFuncByName()}. 

There are several different methods to call functions in mobile agent 
space from the binary space using the Embedded Ch API. 
Here we describe the function \textit{Ch\_CallFuncByName()}
\index{Ch\_CallFuncByName()} used in Program 
\ref{prog:server_ex2.c}.
With \textit{Ch\_CallFuncByName()}, a function defined in the mobile 
agent space can be called by its name. 
The prototype of \textit{Ch\_CallFuncByName()} is shown as follows.

int Ch\_CallFuncByName(ChInterp\_t interp, char *name, void *retval, ...);

The first argument is an instance of the Ch interpreter. 
The second argument is a string containing the name of the function to be 
called. 
The function name is associated with a function defined in mobile agent code. 
The third argument is a pointer containing the address of the return value of 
the called function. 
If the called function takes any arguments, the arguments should be listed 
after the third argument, \textit{retval}. 
\textit{Ch\_CallFuncByName()} returns zero on successful execution or 
non-zero on failure.

The other method of executing the function is through the Mobile-C
api function {\bf MC\_CallAgentFunc()} \index{MC\_CallAgentFunc()}. 
This method is seen in the example program, Program \ref{prog:server_ex2.c}.

Figure \vref{fig:example2_output} shows the output when the binary file 
\textit{server} compiled from Program \ref{prog:server_ex2.c} was executed. 
The string generated and the value returned from the function \textit{hello()} 
were printed to the screen after the Enter key was pressed once the mobile 
agent had arrived.

In order to allow mobile agent code to call user defined routines and 
access data sets defined in the binary space, as well as control 
other mobile agents defined in the mobile agent space through the 
Mobile-C API functions, the Mobile-C functionality has to be extended into 
the mobile agent space.
We integrated Ch with the Mobile-C library to provide access to some 
Mobile-C functionalities. 

Figure \vref{fig:chmobilec_package} shows how mobile agent code interfaces 
with the Mobile-C library.
When the function \textit{mc\_function()} is called in mobile agent code,
Ch searches the corresponding interface function \textit{MC\_function\_chdl()} 
in the Mobile-C library, and passes arguments to it by calling the function.
Subsequently, the interface function \textit{MC\_function\_chdl()} invokes the 
target function \textit{MC\_function()}, and passes the return value back to 
the mobile agent space~\cite{EmbeddedCh}.

The prototypes of Mobile-C functions used in the mobile agent space are
declared in \textit{agent.c} through an Embedded Ch function,
\textit{Ch\_DeclareFunc()}.
The data type, \textit{MCAgent\_t}, used as a parameter or return value by 
certain Mobile-C functions for the mobile agent space is also defined in 
\textit{agent.c} by two Embedded Ch functions, 
\textit{Ch\_DeclareVar()} and \textit{Ch\_DeclareTypedef()}~\cite{EmbeddedCh}.
Table \vref{chmobilec_api_cscript} lists the currently implemented functions 
for the mobile agent space.
Two examples are used to demonstrate the applications and features of the 
Mobile-C functionality in the mobile agent space.

This example demonstrates how to send a mobile agent to invoke a service 
provided by a persistent mobile agent registered with the DF.

The server program used in this example is the same as Program 
\vref{prog:server.c}. 
The client program is the same as Program \vref{prog:client_ex2.c} except 
that it calls the function \textit{MC\_SendAgentMigrationMessageFile()} three
times to send out three mobile agents.
The first mobile agent sent to the remote agency is 
shown in Program 
\vref{prog:mobileagent1_ex4.xml}.
The execution of the mobile agent code will register two services with the 
remote DF through the function mc\_RegisterService(). 
The two services are \textit{addition} and \textit{subtraction} which 
provide addition and subtraction of two integers, respectively.
These services also refer to the functions defined in the mobile agent code.
The function \textit{mc\_RegisterService()} \index{mc\_RegisterService()}
takes three parameters. 
An \textit{MCAgent\_t} type variable is the first parameter. 
A system variable of type \textit{MCAgent\_t}, \textit{mc\_current\_agent}, 
is used as the first parameter when services for 
the current mobile agent are registered, as illustrated in Program 
\vref{prog:mobileagent1_ex4.xml}.
The system variable \textit{mc\_current\_agent} 
is declared in \textit{agent.c} using the function \textit{Ch\_DeclareVar()} 
to hold the current mobile agent.
An array of pointer to char and an integer are the second and third 
parameters, respectively.
The array holds the name of the services whereas the integer denotes the 
number of the services to be registered. 

The second mobile agent is similar to the first and also registers two
services, \textit{multiplication} and \textit{modulus}, which provides 
multiplication and modulo operation of two integers. 
This mobile agent can be seen in Program \vref{prog:mobileagent2_ex4.xml}.

The third mobile agent sent to the remote agency is 
\textit{} shown in Program 
\vref{prog:mobileagent3_ex4.xml}.
The function \textit{mc\_SearchForService()}\index{mc\_SearchForService()} 
takes five parameters.
The first parameter is the name of the service to be found.
The second parameter is the address of an array of ponter to char that 
holds the names of all the mobile agents with the desired service.
Likewise, the third parameter is the address of an array of pointer to 
char that holds the desired service name associated with all the found 
mobile agents.
The fourth parameter is the address of a one-dimensional integer array that 
holds the IDs of all the mobile agents with the desired service.
The last parameter is the address of an integer denoting the number of mobile 
agents that have been found. 
In this example, once the search for \textit{addition} service is done, the 
first mobile agent with this service will be returned by the function 
\textit{mc\_FindAgentByID()}\index{mc\_FindAgentByID()} with a parameter as 
the first element of array \textit{agentIDs}.
In this example, the first found mobile agent is 
\textit{service\_provider\_1}.
The function \textit{addition()} defined in \textit{service\_provider\_1} 
will be called through the function \textit{mc\_CallAgentFunc()} to perform 
addition of two integers.
Since \textit{mc\_CallAgentFunc()}\index{mc\_CallAgentFunc()} can only pass 
one argument to the invoked 
function, the address of a data structure with two integer members is passed 
to \textit{addition()} in this example.
The return value of \textit{addition()} is assigned to the variable 
\textit{retval}.
The string \textit{Result of addition 44 + 45 is 89.} will be printed to the 
screen at the end.

% Synchronization Support int he Mobile-C Library {{{
\chapter{\label{chap:synchronization}Synchronization Support in the Mobile-C library}
In a Mobile-C agency, mobile agents are executed by independent AEEs. 
A user might also need to design a multi-threaded application where a Mobile-C 
agency itself is one of the many threads that handle different tasks.
The Mobile-C library provides support for synchronization among mobile 
agents and threads.
The synchronization API functions are used to protect shared resources as well 
as provide a method of deterministically timing the execution of mobile agents 
and threads.

The internal implementation consists of a linked list of 
Portable Operating System Interface for UNIX (POSIX) compliant synchronization 
variables, namely, mutexes, condition variables, and semaphores. 
Each node in the linked list is a synchronization variable which is assigned 
or given a unique identification number. 
The API functions can be called from the binary or mobile agent 
space to initialize the synchronization variables and access them by their 
unique identification numbers in the linked list.

A Mobile-C synchronization variable is an abstract variable, initialized
by the function {\it MC\_SyncInit()} \index{MC\_SyncInit()}\index{mc\_SyncInit()}.
Once it has been initialized, it may be used as a mutex, condition variable, 
or semaphore.
No further function calls are necessary to change a generic synchronization
variable to one of the types. However, once a synchronization variable is
used as a mutex, condition variable, or semaphore, it should not be used again
as a different type. For instance, if calls to 
\begin{verbatim}
MC_SyncInit(500);
MC_MutexLock(500);
\end{verbatim}
are made, initializing a synchronization variable with ID ``500'', and locking
it as a mutex, it should not be then used with any of the condition variable or
semaphore functions.

The application of the Mobile-C synchronization mechanism is illustrated by 
the example below.

The Mobile-C library allows synrchonization among agents via
mutexes, condition variables, and semaphores. Each type of synchronization
variable is used for different features. Perhaps the most common and basic
of these variables is the mutex.

The client program shown in Program \vref{prog:client_ex5.c} starts a Mobile-C
agency listening on port \textit{5050} and subsequently sends two mobile 
agents to 
the remote agency running on host \textit{localhost} at port 
\textit{5051}.
The mobile agents are shown in Program \vref{prog:mobileagent1_ex5.xml} 
and Program \vref{prog:mobileagent2_ex5.xml}. These mobile agents will use
a mutex to guard an operation that may not be performed by two agents
simultaneously.

This example demonstrates the ability of a Mobile-C mutex to protect
a resource that may be shared between two agents. Any real or
imaginary resource that should
not be accessed simultaneously by more than one entity at a time should
be guarded by a mutex. The resource may be a shared variable, or something
more abstract such as control of a robot arm. If there is only one robot arm,
then only one entity, an agent in this case, should be able to control it at a 
time.

In our particular example, the tasks our agents are going to perform are
imaginary. Each task is represented instead by the ``sleep()'' function and
the printing of a message,
which causes execution of that particular agent to pause for a time, as
if it were performing a task. For our example, we will intentionally
cause our agents to collide execution times to demonstrate that our 
mutex works. Examining our client program, Program 
\vref{prog:client_ex5.c},
we see that we set a two second interval between sending the agents. However,
the task that each agent tries to perform will be five seconds long. This
means that the second agent will arrive while the first agent is in the middle
of performing its simulated task. The execution output will demonstrate that
the second agent will not begin its task until the first agent is finished.

Semaphores are also used to guard resources in which a limited number of
entities may access at a time. Since the behaviour and usage of semaphores are
similar to that of a mutex, an example is not provided here. Please see
the demo in directory \texttt{<MCPACKAGE>/demos/agent\_semaphore\_example/} for an example.

Condition variables are also useful in multi-threaded applications in order
for threads to sleep and wait for a signal. Program

  variable immediately after arriving at an agency. Program 
\vref{prog:cond_agent_2} shows an agent that will send a signal to the condition
variable the first agent in Program \ref{prog:cond_agent_1} is waiting on, thereby
causing the first agent to wake up and continue execution.

\section{Synchronization Between Binary and Agent Spaces}
The synchronization variables initialized using MC\_SyncInit() are accessible
in both agent space and binary space, enabling agents to synchronize with 
binary threads. Again, all three Mobile-C synchronization variable types:
mutexes, condition variables, and semaphores, may be used in both
binary and agent space. 

Referring the example server code in Program
\vref{prog:binary_sync_example_server}, we show a piece of code where
a binary program containing a Mobile-C agency must perform a
subroutine involving a shared resource, protecting it with a mutex. 
The shared resource will
be accessible from both the main() binary thread as well as any agents
which are residing in the agency. As such, the server code 
initializes and uses a mutex to protect the shared resource. In our 
example agent shown in Program \vref{prog:binary_sync_example_agent},
we see that this agent needs to access the same shared resource,
and so it must first lock the mutex before doing so. This example
demonstrates that the mutex will prevent both the agent and binary
thread from accessing the resource simultaneously

Referring now to 
Program \vref{prog:binary_cond_example_server} and Program 
\vref{prog:binary_cond_example_agent}, we demonstrate the use of 
Mobile-C condition variables to synchronize an agent with a binary thread.
The binary space thread program shown in Program \ref{prog:binary_cond_example_server}
simply waits on a condition variable. The agent shown in Program
\ref{prog:binary_cond_example_agent} signals the binary space thread
with a call to {\it mc\_CondSignal()}, causing the binary space
thread to run once.

Using the Mobile-C library, multiple agencies may be initialized 
within the same program. This is useful in cases where the agencies
may have different AEE configuration properties, privileges, etc. 
Ch is the chosen AEE of Mobile-C. 
Functions such as MC\_CopyAgent() and MC\_AddAgent() become useful
in such cases. 

In the example shown in Program \vref{prog:multiple_agency_server},
we demonstrate a program with two agencies, listening on ports
5051 and 5052, respectively. In our simple example, the server
simple duplicates every agent arriving to the agency on port 5051
and adds a copy to the agency on port 5052. 

Note that the 
MC\_CopyAgent() function is necessary here because Mobile-C
functions which retrieve agents from agencies only retrieve references
to the agents, not copies of the agents. The MC\_CopyAgent() function performs
a deep copy on the agent structure so that it may be used in another
agency. Also note that setting the copied agent's status to 
``MC\_WAIT\_CH'' ensures that it will execute again upon entering the 
second agency.

% {{{ Mobile-C Security Module
\chapter{Mobile-C Security Module \label{chap:Security}}
The Mobile-C package (version 1.10.@@) includes a security module. 
This security module is intended to provide secure migration process of 
  mobile agents and ACL messages from one agency to another. 
Before the migration process, both agencies must authenticate each other 
  successfully. 
After that, an encrypted mobile agent is transferred and its integrity 
  is verified at the receiver side. 
The security module helps guard against man-in-the-middle attacks and
  eavesdropping, and provides a strong authentication of the 
  agencies involved in the migration process.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Security Module Architecture and Overview {{{
\section{Security Module Architecture and Overview}
The Mobile-C security module is inspired by the SSH protocol.
When a security-enabled agency attempts to contact another agency for 
  the migration of a mobile agent or an ACL message, both
  agencies must authenticate each other before the  migration process. 
A successful authentication creates a trust between the two agencies.

Each security-enabled agency must contain a \textit{known\_host} file 
  and a pair of private (\textit{rsa\_priv}) and public (\textit{rsa\_pub}) 
  key files.
These files are provided to each agency by the administrator at 
  startup time. 
The \textit{known\_host} file contains the host name and public key 
  of each agency in the network, as an identifier. 
By default, each agency trusts all the agencies that are listed 
  in the \textit{known\_host} file. 
The \textit{rsa\_priv} and \textit{rsa\_pub} key files contains the 
  private and public key of the agency.

% Preparation to Run Security Enabled Agency  {{{
\section{Preparation to Run Security Enabled Agency}
Before running a Mobile-C agency with the security option, 
  the following files are required.
\begin{enumerate}
\item A known host file (\text{known\_host})
\item A pair for public (\textit{rsa\_pub}) and private 
      (\textit{rsa\_priv}) key files
\end{enumerate} 
  are required to be created. 
These are \textit{known\_host} file and \textit{private key} file.  
A small utility source program 
  \begin{verbatim} [MobileC-SRC_HOME]/src/util/mc_keygen.c \end{verbatim} 
  is provided with the Mobile-C library to create a pair of public 
  and private key files for an agency. 
When you make the Mobile-C library the executable for this source program
  can be found in 
  \begin{verbatim} [Mobile-C_HOME]/bin/mc_keygen \end{verbatim}
It is required to create a separate pair of public and private key file
  for each agency. 
That means if there are \textit{n} agencies in a network then \textit{n}
  number of public and private key file pairs are required.
The private key files can be created in plaintext or encrypted 
  form. Details can be found in section 9.3.1.
The known host file needs to be built manually after creating public
  and private key files.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Generating Key Files {{{
\subsection{Generating Key Files}
A utility program {\bf mc\_genkey} \textit{([MobileC-Home]/bin/mc\_genkey)} is 
used to create public and private key files.
This utility program can create a private key in plain text or cipher text.
To generate the key files with private key in plain text, you can execute the 
{\bf mc\_genkey} as 
\begin{verbatim}
$./mc_genkey -rsakeys -pt
Seeding the random number generator 
Generating the RSA key [ 1024-bit ] 
Exporting public key in rsa_pub 
Exporting the private key in rsa_priv 
Done.

\end{verbatim}
where \textit{-pt} means to generate private key in plain text. 
Similarly,
\begin{verbatim}
$./mc_genkey -rsakeys -en
Enter Passphrase (A-Z, a-z, 0-9)to encrypt privatekey file
(remember your passphrase otherwise encrypted private key file is useless)
>  alpha1234

Seeding the random number generator 
Generating the RSA key [ 1024-bit ] 
Exporting public key in rsa_pub 
Exporting the private key in rsa_priv 
encrypted. 
done. 
keys generated.
\end{verbatim}

would generate the private key in encrypted form, where \textit{en} stands 
for encryption. 
Here we a passphrase (\textit{alpha1234})is provided to encrypt the private 
  key file. 
With this option it prompts for the passphrase that is used to encrypt the 
  rsa private key. 
Here we entered a passphrase (\textit{alpha1234}) to encrypt the private 
  key file.
You can enter a string maximum upto 32 bytes in length consisting of small 
  or capital alphabet and/or 1-9 digits. 
The same passphrase is required by the Mobile-C agency to decrypt the 
  private key file.
With both options, it generates the public key file in plain text.
The output file names are \textit{rsa\_pub} for public key and
\textit{rsa\_priv} for private key.

% Known Host file {{{
\subsection{Known Host File}
After creating the key files for all the agencies in a network the 
  \textit{known\_host} file needs to be created manully.
The sample \textit{known\_host} file is shown in Figure ~\ref{fig:knownhost}. 
To proceed, create a file using a text editor with name 
  \textit{known\_host}. 
Type the name of the first agency (as shown \textit{Host Name} in 
Figure ~\ref{fig:knownhost}) and 
copy its public key from \textit{rsa\_pub} file. Insert the record 
separation character \# and type the same for second agency and continue.
Make sure that the name for the \textit{known\_host} file is 
\textit{``known\_host"}. After creating the 
\textit{known\_host} file, copy the \textit{known\_host} file to each \
agency and the \textit{rsa\_priv} file on the respective
agencies (the same directory from where you will run the Mobile-C 
agency). 
Public and private key files are always created as a pair this means that
  any text encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted with the
  corresponding (paired) private key.
Therefore, please make sure that the copied private key 
(\textit{rsa\_priv}) to an agency must correspond to the public key
that is mentioned infront of the name of this agency in \textit{

% Examples {{{
\section{Examples -- Mobile-C Security}
A Mobile-C security enable agency can be executed with encypted or plaintext
  private key. 
When you execute a Mobile-C agency it will look for private key file named
  \textit{rsa\_priv} in the current directory. 
If the private key is encrypted and the passphrase is not provided in Mobile-C
  agency C program then it will prompt for the passphrase.
\texttt{<MCPACKAGE>/demos/} contains two demos 
  (\textit{hello\_world\_secure} and \textit{multi\_task\_example\_secure}) that 
  uses private key in plain text.

Please note that for \textit{hello\_world\_secure} demo, the private and public
  key pair is same for client and server, that is both the client and server 
  program run on the same machine (iel2.engr.ucdavis.edu).
To run the demo in your machine, you to write the name of your machine in 
  \textit{known\_host} file and the mobile agent file (\textit{test1.xml}) 

To run client and server agencies on the two different machines, you need to
  create a pair of public and private keys (see section 9.3.1) and that 
  is for the second machine.  
The first agency can use the already created key files that are provided with
  demos.
After creating the key files, edit the \textit{known\_host} file by including
  the name of other machine and newly created public key from file 
  (\textit{rsa\_priv}), for details see section 9.3.2.
Also copy the newly generated private key file (\textit{rsa\_priv}) and 
  updated \textit{known\_host} file on the other machine in the same 
  directory from where Mobile-C agency will be executed.
Now start the server program and then the client program.

Please note that when you build the demos, the executable 
 files ( \textit{client} and  \textit{server}) for demo 
 \textit{hello\_world \_secure} are in 
 directories \textit{hello\_world\_secure/client} and 
 \textit{hello\_world\_ secure/server} respectively. Similarly, the executable 
 files (\textit{client},  \textit{server1} and  \textit{server2} ) for demo
  \textit{multi\_task\_example\_secure} are in directories 
   \textit{multi\_task\_e xample\_secure/client}, 
   \textit{multi\_task\_example\_secure/server1} and
   \textit{multi\_task\_example\_secure/server2} respectively.

Each agency uses a separate \textit{known\_host},
  public(\textit{rsa\_pub}) and private key {\textit{rsa\_priv} pair files.

The programs \ref{prog:security_server} and \ref{prog:security_client} show 
  \textit{hello\_world\_secure} server and client code respectively.
Please note that the \textit{MC\_AgencyOptions\_t} is required only if the 
  private key file is encrypted. 
Since both programs use the private key file (\textit{rsa\_priv}) in plaintext
  so \textit{MC\_AgencyOptions\_t} is NULL in \textit{MC\_Initialize} function.

If you generate the private key file (\textit{rsa\_priv}) in encrypted form 
   (see section 9.3.1) then the Mobile-C agency requires the same passphrase 
    to decrypt its private key that you have entered to encrypted this file.
In this case \textit{MC\_AgencyOptions\_t} should not be NULL. 
It is a possible that passphrase would not be privided in the code. 
That is, this code can be run if 
  \textit{strcpy(options.passphrase, "xxxx");} is commented out.
In this case, if the private key is encyrpted the Mobile-C agency
  would prompt to enter passphrase at startup otherwise not.

%{{{Communication With Other FIPA Compliant Agent Systems
\chapter{Communication With Other FIPA Compliant Agent Systems}
This section provides some brief examples regarding communication
between Mobile-C and other FIPA compliant agent systems.
\subsection{Example: Receiving a message from a JADE agent}
The following section contains details regarding an example where a
Mobile-C agent receives a message from a JADE agent. This example is
included to provide a brief overview of how FIPA ACL communication
operates between Mobile-C agencies and JADE agencies.

\subsubsection{Start a Mobile-C Agency}
The first step in the example is to start a Mobile-C agency and a suitable
agent to wait for a message. An example agency which performs these tasks
may be found in the directory \texttt{<MCPACKAGE>/demos/ jade\_to\_mc\_example/}.
To start the agency, simply go to the directory and execute the server
with the command
\begin{verbatim}
./server
\end{verbatim}
The server will start and load the sample agent named ``mobagent1'' in one step,
which should produce the following output (or similar):
\begin{verbatim}
Mobile-C Started

MobileC > This is mobagent1 from the agency at port 5050.
Now, I am going to wait until I receive a message. Waiting...
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Create a JADE container}
The next step is to start a JADE agency. Instructions on how to obtain and
install JADE may be found at the website \texttt{<http://jade.tilab.com>} .
Once JADE in installed, use the command
\begin{verbatim}
java jade.Boot -gui
\end{verbatim}
to start a JADE container. Note that the command may vary across systems depending
on your java distribution and system setup. This command should produce a window
similar to the following:

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4in]{figure/jade_to_mc_example/jade_main_window.png}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Start a JADE dummy agent}
The next step is to start a ``dummy'' agent by clicking on the button indicated by the 
large arrow in the previous figure. This should produce a second window
which should resemble the following image.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4in]{figure/jade_to_mc_example/dummy_agent_window_blank.png}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Send a message to Mobile-C}
There are several fields in this empty ACL message that need to be set before the
message will be successfully passed to our Mobile-C agent. The first field to fill
out is the \texttt{Receivers}, which indicates the recipients for our message.
We wish for our Mobile-C agent ``mobagent1'' to be our sole recipient. Add 
``mobagent1'' by right-clicking on the \texttt{Receivers} textbox and selecting the
\texttt{Add} option. Fill out the box as shown in the following image:

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=2in]{figure/jade_to_mc_example/dummy_agent_receiver_window.png}
\end{center}

After setting the receiver, the rest of the message may be set to whatever is desired.
For this example, our sample message may be seen on the following image.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4in]{figure/jade_to_mc_example/dummy_agent_window_complete.png}
\end{center}

Once your desired message parameters are in place, click on the ``Send Message'' button
indicated by the arrow in the previous figure. The message will be sent to the agent
waiting at the Mobile-C agency that was previously started. The agent should
receive the message and produce the following output:
\begin{verbatim}
mobagent1 Got a message!
Message is from da0@boxzor:1099/JADE
The content is Hello mobagent1. This is sample content.
\end{verbatim}
This indicates that \texttt{mobagent1} has successfully received the
message from JADE.

\subsection{Example: Sending a message from Mobile-C to JADE}
This example illustrates a Mobile-C agent sending an ACL message to a
JADE agent.  The example will be presented in a step by step fashion and all
files may be found in the directory \texttt{<MCPACKAGE>/demos/mc\_to\_jade\_example/}.

\subsubsection{Start a JADE container with a ``PingAgent'' agent}
The first step is to start a JADE container with a responsive agent. In this
example, we will use a demo ``PingAgent'' agent which is provided with JADE. The
agent source code may be found in the JADE subdirectory 
\texttt{jade/src/examples/PingAgent/PingAgent.java} . After installing JADE,
run the command
\begin{verbatim}
java jade.Boot pingme:examples.PingAgent.PingAgent
\end{verbatim}
from the \texttt{jade/src/} directory to start a JADE main container and 
invoke an agent of type ``PingAgent'' named ``pingme''. The ``PingAgent'' agent
contains a behaviour which receives messages and replies with a standard 
reply message. The ``PingAgent'' expects incoming messages to have a performative
of ``query-ref'', and for the content field to contain the text ``ping''. 

\subsubsection{Start a Mobile-C agency with a sender agent}
A Mobile-C agency and agent for use in the example has already been
created and reside in the directory \texttt{<MCPACKAGE>/demos/mc\_to\_jade\_example/} .
After compiling Mobile-C and the Mobile-C demos, simply go to the directory and
run the 'client' executable.
\begin{verbatim}
./client
\end{verbatim}
The executable will automatically start a Mobile-C agency and load an agent
named ``mobagent1''. The agent is programmed to send an ACL message to 
``pingme'' at the local JADE container and wait for a response message. 
Upon receiving the response, the agent will print the contents of the 
response message. The Mobile-C agent output should look something like
\begin{verbatim}
Mobile-C Started
Sending agent to self...
Done.
mobagent2 Creating new ACL message...
mobagent2 sending ACL message...
Received a message from pingme@boxzor:1099/JADE.
Content is 'alive'.

%{{{ Mobile-C Agent Porting Guide from v1.9.x to v1.10.x
\chapter{Mobile-C Agent Porting Guide from v1.9.x to v1.10.x}
This chapter provides a brief overview of changes made to the agent
xml code from version 1.9 to version 1.10. Agents in the v1.10 series
of Mobile-C will not be compatible with the v1.9 series of agencies
and vice versa. Additional features such as saved agent variables have
necessitated a reorganization of the agent XML format. 

\section{Overview of major changes}
Some major changes in the agent xml format from version 1.9 to version 
1.10 include the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The \texttt{<GAF\_MESSAGE>} tag has been renamed to
  \texttt{<MOBILEC\_MESSAGE>}.
\item The \texttt{<TASK>} tag has been renamed to \texttt{<TASKS>}. 
  The attributes within the old \texttt{<TASK>} tag, \texttt{task} and
  \texttt{num}, remain the same.
\item The \texttt{<DATA>} tag has been renamed to \texttt{<TASK>}. Within
the new \texttt{<TASK>} tag, the \texttt{name} attribute, which specifies
the name of the variable to return upon task completion, has been renamed 
to \texttt{return}. 
\end{enumerate}
